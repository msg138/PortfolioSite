As my first post on my website, I'm just going to clear some things up for myself, to set a good path forward for how I will continue to post on my site.

## Creation of my Portfolio Site

Starting with the creation of my Portfolio site. As a Frontend Developer, it is critical that I have a space where
I can showcase the work that i've done, as well as a place to share my thoughts and learnings with others who may
benefit from them. In this, I was getting held up by how I wanted the site to look, as well as the technologies that
I was going to use to create the site, as I wanted to use something that would be beneficial to my career as a 
Frontend Developer.

After spending months coming up with various designs, I decided to settle on a simple minimalistic design with a larger
font size. I feel this allows me to get straight to the point and if there is anything else that is missing from the
site, this can be handled in the interview process (or I can be emailed.)

In terms of technology that I was expecting myself to use, I went through a few iterations (as can probably be seen on
GitHub for my portfolio site.) Some attempts involved [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), and other attempts involved [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/), as I wanted to use a
Static Site Generator for the performance and SEO benefits that they provide. Then comes along with what I decided to use,
[Astro](https://astro.build/). I like the development flow of Astro, especially its simple templating that seems similar to 
React JSX. The biggest feature I appreciate about Astro, is the ability to CHOOSE what JavaScript is sent to the client,
as by default there is No JavaScript sent. This is Amazing, especially when compared to that of NextJS and Gatsby, which
send the JavaScript needed at least for React Hydration, which I have noticed contributes poorly to the performance of
the page.

## Why am I posting?

I would like to start a "*blog*", but I know this requires having a good schedule for posting, in order to bring in loyal
readers. Fortunately, I am not looking for loyal readers, just looking to put my thoughts online, and if they benefit
someone else, I will be happy with that. The primary audience however, would be potential recruiting managers or those
looking for a Frontend Developer to help with their project(s).

## My Developer Journey Thus Far

I could include the time that I spent learning programming languages and concepts in grade schools, however this does not
translate directly to being professionally able to produce quality code as I have found out whilst working in a professional
setting.

It started with me getting a job with Hostwinds, as a Frontline Technical Support agent. This was probably the best start
to my journey, as it allowed me to get a good understanding of the lower level parts of a website. Encouraging me to focus on web server
administration, handling emails, DNS, and everything else that goes into most, if not all websites, so that I was able
to better assist our clients. This lead me to have quite a great operating knowledge of Linux and commonly used web servers (Apache, Nginx, Litespeed)

After working on the Frontline for Hostwinds for a couple years, a position opened on our Frontend team, which I promptly applied for.
While I did not have the requested experience on the job posting for this position, I am thankful that Hostwinds gave me a
chance to prove my worth. At the start there were longer hours, which gave me ample time to get up to speed with the technologies
that were being used by our then Frontend team. This included the MaterialUI React Library, and the React framework itself.

Fast forward about 1.5 years and we had released a polished version of the Hostwinds marketing site. Around this time was
when I was declared to be the Lead Frontend Engineer at Hostwinds, as I had been able to grow and meet / exceed the expectations
and needs of Hostwinds. 

## Where I see my Journey taking me

At the moment, I see myself staying in the Frontend Web Development space for a long time, if not for the indefinite future.
This is because while I understand the need and use of a Full-stack Developer, I am under the belief that a Frontend Developer
that focuses on the Frontend, will be able to create more performant, accessible and modern sites than one who does not specialize
in this regard. 

Areas I am fully aware I can grow and plan to prioritize include Accessibility for websites, creating Performant and still
beautiful websites and web applications. Unfortunately I feel as though my design skills are not to the highest level they could be,
I still desire to focus on the importance of accessibility and performance.

## What my future posts look like

I am hoping to create multiple posts in the future that cover things such as a new Technology I may have found to be interesting,
interesting solutions to problems I face, or even an personal update about myself or something else I may be interested in.

As this is a personal blog, there will be no direct path or aim for the posts that follow. 

I appreciate You (whomever you are) for taking the time to read this post. I hope that any posts I create in the future
may benefit you or someone else in need.

Thanks,

Michael George
