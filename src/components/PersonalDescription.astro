        Hey there, I'm a <a href="/a-developer">frontend engineer</a> based in the beautiful city of Seattle. My passion lies in building performant web applications and creating awesome user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find some of the projects I have produced on my <a href="https://github.com/msg138">GitHub Profile</a>.
        When I'm not coding or working on projects, I love spending time with my familyâ€”. We enjoy exploring the beautiful surroundings of Seattle together. And when I need some me-time, you can find me playing <a href="/a-gamer">video games</a>, belting out tunes at karaoke nights, savoring delicious sushi, and cheering for UFC and F1 events.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to <a href="/reachable">connect with me</a> on social media or drop me a line if you're ever in Seattle! Let's geek out about frontend and technology together.
    </p>
