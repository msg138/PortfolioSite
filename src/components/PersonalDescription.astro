    <p>
        I'm a <a href="/a-developer">frontend engineer</a> based in the beautiful city of Seattle. My passion lies in building performant web applications and creating awesome user experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find some of the projects I have produced on my <a href="https://github.com/msg138" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">GitHub Profile</a>.
        When I'm not coding or working on projects, I love spending time with my family—. We enjoy exploring the beautiful surroundings of Seattle together. And when I need some me-time, you can find me playing <a href="/a-gamer">video games</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to <a href="mailto:anything@themichaelgeorge.com" target="_blank">connect with me</a> on social media or drop me a line if you're ever in Seattle! Let's geek out about frontend and technology together.
