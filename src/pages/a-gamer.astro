    <h1>Is A Gamer</h1>
    <p>
        I appreciate a good game every now and then. If you are looking for more friends on the various game platforms, I am always looking for more people to chill with and have a good time playing games.

        I am a big fan of the Pokemon Franchise games, though I enjoy playing other games such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">RimWorld</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Oxygen Not Included</a>. My all time favorite game would be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/Dishonored/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Dishonored</a>.
